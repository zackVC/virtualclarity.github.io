•	LastName - (M) – VarChar64
A contact with the same Name cannot exist more than once with the same Email Address
•	Email - (M) – VarChar256
Email address must be unique
•	Phone - (O) – VarChar64
•	Address 1 – (O) VarChar1024
•	Address 2 – (O) - VarChar1024
•	City – (O) - VarChar128
•	State - VarChar128
•	Zip Code – VarChar40

•	Phone (O) – VarChar (64)
•	Description (description) - VarChar 1024
•	Position - (O) - VarChar100
•	Manager – (O) - VarChar254
MD does not validate if Manager exists as a Contact
•	Department – (O) - (O) – VarChar64
•	Employer - (O) - VarChar100
•	EmployerAddressOne (O) - VarChar1024
•	EmployerAddressTwo (O) - VarChar1024
•	EmployerCity (O) - VarChar100
•	EmployerZipCode (O) – VarChar40

•	EmployerEmail (O) – VarChar256
•	Team
list of teams, semi-colon delimited, will be validated against MD and if not will provide the option to insert
•	Active – Y/N

The File is a zip file containing two files:
1.	Contacts template in CSV file format –this will be blank but MD will be using this tab to load the data
2.	Sample as  excell file– this file will have Field Name, Field Type, Description and one or two sample records
